# Travel Planner 
The purpose of this project was to build a MERN + GraphQL stack one-stop shop application for travel enthusiasts (similar to Tripadvisor). The original intent was to let users search for destinations, search/book flights, and add cities & attractions into a 'saved places' list. In addition, users could sign up and post about their future travel plans, write about their travel experiences, and even ask for travel tips from other users - which is a working functionality in the app in its current state.
